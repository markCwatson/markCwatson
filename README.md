My name is Mark Watson, and I am an Embedded Software Engineer working in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. I am a licensed Professional Engineer (P.Eng.) in the province of Nova Scotia, and I have Bachelor's (B.Eng.) and Master's (M.A.Sc.) degrees in Electrical Engineering from Dalhousie University.

# ðŸ˜„ Experience:
Most of my industry experience is related to embedded firmware development on ARM Cortex and RISC-V based microcontrollers with experience in mixed-language developemnt in C and java, FreeRTOS, linker scripts, low-level drivers, develping multi-process.threadded python applications, and more. My graduate studies focused more on hardware including integrated circuit design and Radio Frequency (RF) circuits and systems.

# ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
I am actively working to expand my programming abilities beyond embedded systems by learning other software engineering concepts like operating systems, networking, security, system design, web application development, databases, and more. I have experience with C++, Java, and python and am currently learning JavaScript and frameworks like Django, Node.js, and MongoDB for web development and pytorch for machine learning applications.

# âš¡ Fun facts:
- I have 5 children, all boys. When I started my education I had one child. By the time I finished my Master's degree I had five!
- In 2022, I left a Ph.D. programm to focus on my family and career. I am utilizing this opportunity to dedicate myself to developing my software engineering abilities.
- I teach at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I have had 5 teaching positions so far and counting!
